# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the site’s displayed name to include the word “love” in the browser tab/title used for link previews.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the HTML document `<title>` in `frontend/index.html` to an English, user-facing title that includes “love” (case-insensitive).
- Keep all existing multi-step flow, animations, and UI copy unchanged aside from the document title.

**User-visible outcome:** The browser tab/page title (and commonly the shared link preview title) displays an updated site name that includes “love”.
